# File-Integrity-Monitor

The security of a user's data and files is critical to its success, and it's essential to have tools in place to ensure the integrity and security of these assets. One such tool is File Integrity Monitoring (FIM), which provides a way to track changes to files and directories and detect any unauthorized or unexpected changes. This project aims to develop an effective FIM solution that can provide a way to monitor and detect any changes to files, directories and file metadata in real-time. 

We wanted to create a file integrity monitor which could continuously monitor the validity of files in a directory, as well as an individual file.
